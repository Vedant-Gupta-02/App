# Expense Splitter Web App

This is a complete web application for splitting expenses among groups. It's built using Python with Flask for the backend, SQLite for the database, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Bootstrap for the frontend. This stack keeps it simple and self-contained.

## Features
- User authentication (register, login, logout).
- Create groups and add members (users can join groups via invites or direct add if admin).
- Add expenses with description, amount, payer, and participants (split equally among participants).
- Automatically calculates each member's balance in the group.
- Settlement view suggesting who should pay whom to minimize transactions (using a simple greedy algorithm).
- Export group balances as CSV or share via a copyable link (link to group page).
- Currency switching: Users can input exchange rates and view debts in a single currency.
